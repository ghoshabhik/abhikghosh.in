I spend lot of my work time developing Spring boot applications. Some of the projects I do are quick exploration more often than a huge production ready application. These exploration type projects are to test some ideas or to quickly show a functionality to the cutomer to get their feedback. I always wanted to have a simple development environment which are portable but wont put me in an entanglement of hundreds of moving components. 

Since Spring Boot 2.3 - the docker image build functionality has quite solved my problem and helped my minimalistic setup with a handful of steps. I still would like to get an Java development environment setup with intellJ similar to what Remote Container plugin enables VS Code to do for Python, Go or Javascript. However, I am quite happy with my current setup. Also, please note, I'm writing this as a Windows OS user, your setup may vary a little for other OS. 

### Tools we need: 
* IntelliJ Idea - Community edition will do. Community edition requires the Docker Plugin to be installed manually which is available in IntelliJ Marketplace. 
* Docker Desktop

### Here are the Steps

**Step 1** - Install [IntelliJ Idea latest version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). <br />
**Step 2** - Install [Docker Desktop latest version](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
