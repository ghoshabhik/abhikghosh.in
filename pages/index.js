          <p>You have found my personal slice on internet. I am a Data Solution Architect, currently working at Tata Consultancy Services in Mumbai
            as an Associate Consultant.
          </p>
          <p>I <Link href="/article" passHref ><a className="text-websitedark-orange font-semibold"> write </a></Link> about latest technologies, development and about some how-tos to help the developer community around the world.
            I also talk on Data Engineering groups and meetups. I have a deep passion towards clean code and efficient design techniques.
          </p>
          <p>I&apos;m from a city called Kolkata, in the eastern part of India. My love for programming begun at an early age with <a className="text-websitedark-orange font-semibold" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitrust_(film)" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                >Antitrust</a>, a childhood movie. Fascinated with Milo&apos;s character, I kept spending hours on computer - turned out, I was mostly playing games though.
                Real learning started in my GWBasic, QBasic classes. Then things became serious! However, I always get excited about the idea to solve world&apos;s biggest problems from the corner of a garage :)
